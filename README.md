# gdevelop-minecraft
This branch is limited to the programming of creative mode in Minecraft. This is a much more feasable task due to the player of the game being the one that creates the world. This branch should not include any aspects of survival minecraft(ex. damage, random world generation, mobs, etc.) The current stage of creative mode should only include the building of blocks(dynamic blocks like redstone are allowed). In the future, the creative mode in this version aims to achieve parity with the official Minecraft creative mode.
